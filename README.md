#Data Analysis Project for XYZ
#Client Description
#XYZ is a private firm in the U.S. that, due to remarkable growth in the cab industry in recent years and the presence of multiple key players in the market, is considering making an investment in this sector. As #part of their Go-to-Market (G2M) strategy, they want to understand the market before making a final decision.

#Project Deliverable
#You have been provided with multiple datasets containing information on two cab companies. Each file represents different aspects of the customer profile. XYZ is interested in actionable insights to help them #identify the right company for their investment.

#The outcome of your delivery will be a presentation to XYZ's executive team, which will be judged based on the quality of your analysis, the visuals provided, and the value of your recommendations and insights.
